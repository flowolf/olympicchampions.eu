A nifty way to reimagine the Olympic rankings

I hacked this together in a couple hours to illustrate the power of the
European Union as a combined force on the world stage.  It's based on a slick
& simple [API](http://www.medalbot.com/) by Ed Kelley, combined with [a handy flags library](https://github.com/lafeber/world-flags-sprite/)
from Martijn Lafeber, [Twitter Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), and a
quick & dirty python script from me.

Should you want to run it yourself, the instructions are pretty simple:

1. Download this code
2. Execute `generator.py`.  Note that you must have `requests` installed.
